# FA23-First-and-Third-Perspective-using-Virtual-Reality
## Description
The purpose of the study is to compare differences in safety and performance between first person and third person perspectives in a 3D virtual reality (VR) crane simulation exercise. Six participants with construction industry experience were asked to complete two tasks, using both first person and third person perspectives, for a total of four exercise scenarios. Participants were then interviewed about their experiences, focusing on their assessment of the benefits and challenges posed by the first person and third person perspectives. While participants widely agreed that first person perspective was the easiest and most intuitive option for controlling a crane, half of participants indicated that the third person perspective is a valuable option that helps the crane operator better assess their work task. Future studies are necessary to fully understand the benefit that third person perspective can provide to crane operators, and the specific application required to deliver this benefit. Based on interview responses received, it is likely that third person perspective provides the highest benefit to crane operators as an addition to, rather than a replacement of, first person perspective.
